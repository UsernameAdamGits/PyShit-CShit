# PyShit
Introducing the most useless repository!

## Why this was made?
I have always wanted to learn coding languages, and I've felt that Python is a good place to start, this repository is dedicated for the many files that I will use for this learning process.
I only made it public because I thought it was funny honestly. (and also i wanted to actually do something with github)

## Can I use this?
Do you really need to use a beginner's badly made Python files and use it for yourself? I don't care to be honest do whatever you want with it but I'm surprised if you find use for this.

## How was this made?
im starting to question why anyone would ask these questions for something like this 

Anyways, I just made it at 3 AM with VSCode and git.

## Where can I learn Python too?
I'd recommend checking out the YouTube channel called Programming with Mosh. They'll be your friend.
Also experiment and stuff or you'll end up in **Tutorial Hell**.

### Thanks for stepping by, my future repo(s) will probably be better than... this.
