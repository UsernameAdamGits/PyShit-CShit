# Welcome back, PyShit (And CShit#!)
Re-introducing the most useless repository! Probably something more useless out there actually!

## Why this was made? What do you mean welcome back?
Back in July 18th 2024, I had wanted to learn coding languages, starting with Python. As a side exercise I chose to make my findings and progress into a Github repository, which eventually progressed into also including C#. It went nowhere, I forgot everything, and it had a weird storyline????? Skip to July 14th, 2025. TODAY!! 4 days until this repo's birthday! That's not a good thing, but I still care enough to relearn these languages and bring PyShit and CShitSharp back! The names are too stupid for me to change them from my young self. Sorry.

## Can I use this?
You wouldn't want to, but you can. No need to credit me, just do whatever. They're just terribly made code files from an amateur.

## How was this made?
I just made it at 3 AM with VSCode and git. Still the same thing today.

## Where can I learn Python and C# too?
I'd recommend checking out the YouTube channel called Programming with Mosh for Python, and Brackeys (welcome back king) for C# as a start, then go towards experimenting and other tutorials, don't watch too much however.

### Thanks for stepping by, my future repo(s) will probably be better than... this. I hope.
This had no reason to be a thing, but who cares?
