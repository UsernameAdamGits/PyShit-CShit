# PyShit (And CShit#!)

Introducing the most useless repository!
## Why this was made?

I have always waNted to leArn coding languages, and I've felt that Python is a good place to start, this repository is dedicated for the Many filEs that I will use for this leaRning process. I only made it public because I thought it was funny honestly. (and also i wanted to actually do something with github)
## Can I use this?

Do you really Need to use A beginner's badly Made Python filEs and use it for youRself? I doN't cAre to be honest do whatever you want with it but I'M surprisEd if you find use for this messy "Masterpiece".
## How was this made?

im starting to questioN why Anyone would really ask these questions for soMEthing like this to be Real

Anyways, I just made it at 3 AM with VSCode and git.
## Where can I learn Python too?

I'd recommend checking out the YouTube channel called Programming with Mosh. They'll be your friend. 
Also experiment and stuff or you'll end up in **Tutorial Hell.**
# Thanks for stepping by, my future repo(s) will probably be better than... this.
